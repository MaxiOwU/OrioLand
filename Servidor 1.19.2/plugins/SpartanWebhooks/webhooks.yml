# This configuration is mainly meant for experienced users.
# You can add or remove pretty much everything you want. There's a limit of 25 fields, and you can't have empty embeds, or you'll
# receive an error. Heavy modification of this configuration file is NOT recommended.

## WARNING: You may experience issues with images loading if you're using APIs to load pictures.
## This is NOT caused by this plugin, but by rate limits from the API -- I cannot do anything about this.
