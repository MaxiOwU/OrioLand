# The amount of time (in ticks) a stage will stay in frame.
# The animation will change frame in two instances:
# 1. If we are proceeding to the next animation stage
# 2. If we are repeating a frame (Seen in animation stage 2)
# This can be defined per stage. If it's not, then this is used as a global value.

# Selected ->reveal<- reward configuration acts differently than the select_reward_symbol configuration.
# Please read the reveal_reward_symbol explanation first
# The main difference is that after the user clicks on reveal_reward_symbol, you can then place the selected revealed items in any position, no matter where they were clicked before, meanwhile
# The select_reward_symbol is bound to the exact slot where the user had clicked and can not be moved to a different position in the other stages
