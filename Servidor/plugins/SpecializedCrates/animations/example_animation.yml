# Please check out the example_animation file to find important info about stages
# The amount of time (in ticks) a stage will stay in frame.
# The animation will change frame in two instances:
# 1. If we are proceeding to the next animation stage
# 2. If we are repeating a frame (Seen in animation stage 2)
# This can be defined per stage. If it's not, then this is used as a global value.
default frame rate: 4

# If it's just R (or the symbol you defined) then the item will become a different random reward every refreshed inventory case
random_reward_symbol: "R"

# These rewards don't become a different random reward every refreshed inventory, you can make them change by setting the rewards symbol in the reset_rewards configuration.
# See semicircle animation for an example on how to reset the reward
reward_symbols:
  - "R1"

# In case the user wants to make a disco out of the filler_items

air_symbol: "A"

# Will show up as a closed_select_reward_item, which will be a clickable item slot, after clicking it the item will become selected_reward_item, use the open_selected_reward_symbol to show the reward after this stage.
# frame_stay_time needs to be defined to -1
select_reward_symbol: "RS"

# At the end of the animation opener's selected slots will either turn instantly into an item or will become a clickable item slot, which after clicked, will reveal an item.

# A spot the player has to click to reveal a random reward. Item is defined in reveal_item. This feature works together with selected_reveal_reward_symbol
# Should be used with the next_stage_symbol feature
reveal_reward_symbol: "RR"

# Selected ->reveal<- reward configuration acts differently than the select_reward_symbol configuration.
# Please read the reveal_reward_symbol explanation first
# The main difference is that after the user clicks on reveal_reward_symbol, you can then place the selected revealed items in any position, no matter where they were clicked before, meanwhile
# The select_reward_symbol is bound to the exact slot where the user had clicked and can not be moved to a different position in the other stages
selected_reveal_reward_symbol: "SR"

# A spot the player has to click to start the next stage. frame_stay_time needs to be defined to -1
next_stage_symbol: "NS"

# When Should The Crate auto_close (in ticks (1 second = 20 ticks)), this is for screens like click to accept the reward or for screens where you need to click on a tile to reveal the reward.
# But if the user takes too long it will simply auto open it for him.
# Ticks until the crate closes after opening all stages
